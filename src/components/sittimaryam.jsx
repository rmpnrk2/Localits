        Sitti Maryam is the Tausug name for Mama Mary. Sitti is a Tuasug title
        given to the daughters or sons of a royal datu while Maryam is the
        Arabic name of Mary found in the Qur’an.

        She studied all that she could, and her father had examined her on all
        points of prayer and found her exceptional. She prayed five times a day
        and each time she was conscientious. This she did for sixty-six years,
        all on her own.
